## 🔧 Coding & DSA Practice

### ✅ Java Practice (DSA Focus)
- Solved several core problems for string and heap manipulation:
  - `LongestPrefix.java` — Used string trimming inside a loop to find shared prefixes.
  - `Palindrome.java` — Checked if a number is a palindrome via two-pointer string approach.
  - `RomanToInt.java` — Basic Roman numeral parser using a `switch-case` helper method.
  - `MinHeap.java` & `StoneWeight.java` — Continued heap implementation practice with priority queue-style problems.

### 🧪 Exercism Problems
- `ColorCode3.java` — Reinforced Java basics like switch-cases and char-to-int mapping with resistor color code logic.
- `RNATranscription.java` — Simple transcription problem converting DNA to RNA characters.

## 🎮 Scrimba Mini-Projects

### 🔲 Blackjack UI Cleanup
- Tweaked the Blackjack project:
  - Edited `index.css`, `index.html`, and `index.js`.
  - Added `table.jpg` background image to enhance the table feel.

### 🍊 Sorting Fruits DOM Game
- Wrote a basic JS fruit sorter:
  - Used array methods and `getElementById` to separate 🍎 & 🍊 into shelves on the page.
  - First time using `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift` in JS (wasn’t a fan of the syntax, but got through it).

## 🧠 Reflections
- Skipped most of the Scrimba JS lessons because Java skills carried hard 😎.
- JS still feels cursed... but I’m adapting to it day by day.
- Nice balance of frontend DOM logic and backend-style Java today — both sides got some love.
