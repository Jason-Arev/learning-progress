✅ Completed

-Rebuilt Two Sum from scratch using Java and a HashMap

-Made sure I actually understood how the HashMap solution works (not just copying)

-Created TwoSumSolution.java inside DSA package

-Implemented a full Graph class using custom Node and Edge types (Exercism)

-Used custom Node and Edge classes

💡 Key Insight
Two Sum isn’t just storing values—it’s storing their indices for instant complement lookups.

In the Graph builder, I finally understood the real purpose of equals() and hashCode(): they let data structures like Set recognize duplicate objects based on content, not memory location.

Maps and Sets hit different when you’re building a real structure instead of just solving a prompt

🤔 Reflection
Today I started with Two Sum, and ended up knocking out more.
The Graph thing kinda humbled me - like, it wasn’t even hard, just vague as hell. But once I started piecing it together and testing each part, it started making sense.
This dev log is for me to retain — not just rush problems to say I did them. No skipping the real learning anymore.
