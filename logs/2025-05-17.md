🗓️ May 17, 2025 — Daily DSA Devlog

✅ Completed:
- Rebuilt `BalancedTree.java` (check if binary tree is height-balanced)
- Implemented `isSameTree.java` (recursive tree structure comparison)
- Solved `HasSubtree.java` using recursive match scanning
- Reinforced `Grains.java` with `BigInteger` logic and edge case handling

🧠 Key Learnings:
- Recursive tree logic depends heavily on clear base cases and correct return chaining
- Tree balance is determined by comparing **depths**, not just value equality
- Direct node reference comparison (`==`) isn't reliable for structural checks
- Clean helper methods (like `sameTree`) make subtree logic reusable and easier to debug

💡 Next Steps:
- Try iterative tree problems (using queue/stack)
- Start a few graph and BFS/DFS setups next week
- Keep logging daily rebuilds + custom notes for each
