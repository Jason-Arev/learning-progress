### 🚀 Project: Skynet Eats Website

#### ✅ What Was Done
- Integrated a **new contact page** (`contact_page.html`) with form and layout improvements.
- Hooked up **navbar navigation** from `index.html` to contact page.
- Created and styled `contact.css` for the form and layout consistency.
- Added `connect.jpg` as visual asset for the contact page.
- Cleaned structure and updated `index.css`.

#### 🧪 Other Work (JavaScript Practice via Exercism)
- ✅ Added `Cards.js` — practice with simple conditionals and return values.
- ✅ Added `VehiclePurchase.js` — basic logic with string comparison and user advice.

#### 📝 Files Touched
- `index.html` — layout tweaks + nav link
- `index.css` — shared style updates
- `contact_page.html` — *new*
- `contact.css` — *new*
- `connect.jpg` — *new image asset*
- `Cards.js` — *new (JS exercise)*
- `VehiclePurchase.js` — *new (JS exercise)*

#### 🧠 Notes
- `submitForm()` still needs a dummy handler (simple `alert()` works for now).
