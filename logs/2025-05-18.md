# 🗓️ May 18, 2025 – Daily Dev Log

## ✅ Completed
- Built `HighScores.java` with full test support:
  - Implemented `latest()`, `personalBest()`, and `personalTopThree()`
  - Fixed constructor logic for both `scores` and `highScores`
  - Defensive copying considered for long-term safety
- Cleaned and debugged `addNewScore()` and `isHighScore()` logic
- Ran and aligned with `HighScoresTest.java` expectations
- Additional work on:
  - `PrefixTree.java` (Trie implementation)
  - `Anagrams.java` (Grouped anagrams using sorted-string keys)

## 💡 Key Insights
- Constructor data must match test expectations to avoid failing behavior
- `.get(index)` vs `.add(index/value)` needs precise intent
- Avoid mutating shared data structures like `highScores` unless copying them
- Caught Java-specific slip-ups like calling methods on primitives (`int.isHighScore()`)

## 🔥 Reflection
- Recovered from confusion between constructors and methods
- Passed all test cases with clean logic
- Built maintainable and readable code
