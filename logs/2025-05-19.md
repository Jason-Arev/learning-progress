# 🚀 Dev Log – May 19, 2025


### 🧠 Files I Messed With Today
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `index.js`

### 🖥️ Tabs Open in VS Code
- Java:
  - `ColorCode.java`
  - `ColorCode2.java`
  - `KthLargest.java`
- Web stuff:
  - `index.html` – just got the base HTML started
  - `style.css` – messing with layout, theme, and button styles
  - `index.js` – JS hooked up for basic logic

### 🔧 What I Actually Did
- Set up the HTML shell for the counter
- Wrote basic CSS for layout and button visuals
- JS linked up for the increment/save logic (pretty light rn)
- Tried out background visuals with a looping gif
- Bounced between this and some Java DSA problems like usual

### 🧠 Thoughts
- Not super heavy work but still got clean reps in
- Balancing frontend and DSA is draining sometimes, but I’m staying sharp
- Feels good having a small project to style while grinding
