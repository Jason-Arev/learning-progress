## ✅ Coding & DSA Practice Wrap-Up

Kept it light today since I had stuff to prep before a trip, but still got some files in and pushed:

- `ValidParenthesis.java` – Stack-based bracket checker, clean and simple.
- `MergeLists.java` – Merged two linked lists, used two-pointer approach.
- `DifferenceOfSquaresCalculator.java` – Quick math logic for Exercism.
- `Acronym.java` – Regex-based acronym generator, pulls initials after spaces/hyphens and capitalizes.

Not much else, just made sure I didn’t let the day go to waste. Even light days still count.
